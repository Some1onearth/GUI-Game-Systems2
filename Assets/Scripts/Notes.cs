	currentHealth = currentHealth + healthPotion;
	the players current health is equal to the current health that the player has, plus the increased value or the health potion we drank

	valueA = valueA - valueB
	currentHealth -= healthPotion; (shorthand of below)
	currentHealth = currentHealth - healthPotion;
=	equals sets a value (assigning a value)
==	is, is equal (checking values)
	if(currentHealth == maxHealth) <---- is equal checks and is found inside conditions
	if(current health is equal to the same value as maxHealth) then we are fully healed
	{
		= <------- equals this Assigns a value this makes changes
	}

!	not	
!=	(check) not equal too <----- found inside conditions
